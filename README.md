# Mediqe 

**Comprehensive Backend Platform for Healthcare & Medical Solutions**

---
 
## üìñ Project Overview

Mediqe is a modular, scalable backend system designed for healthcare applications, featuring robust user management, appointment scheduling, medical records, doctor-patient consultations, and admin/role-based dashboards. Built with modern Python/Django best practices and ready for production deployment.

## üèó Applications Structure

**All the following are Django apps located in the `appointment_mediqe/` directory:**

- **accounts** Handles user authentication, registration, permissions, and role management (doctor, patient, admin).
- **appointment_mediqe** Main Django project configuration app (settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI, etc.).
- **appointments** Manages creation, scheduling, and tracking of doctor-patient appointments.
- **chats** Implements chat functionality for real-time or asynchronous communication between patients and doctors.
- **dashboards** Provides dashboards and summary views for various user roles (admin, doctor, patient).
- **healthdatas** Handles the storage and retrieval of general health data for users (e.g., vitals, health history).
- **medical_records** Manages secure storage of patient medical records, prescriptions, and related files.
- **notifications** Sends notifications and system alerts to users (via email, push, or in-app).
- **organizations** Manages healthcare organizations, clinics, and their relationships with users.
- **payments** Handles payment processing, transaction history, and integration with payment gateways.

All of these are Django applications and should be added to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django settings.
